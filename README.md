# nofuss
Compiler for the WolfCore cpu architecture

Does not support:
- functions because
- ... it does not support scoping (yet, might be handy)
- any other datatype then signed int
- syntax checking (it will simply say "syntax error", lovely...)

It will support (hopefully):
- if/else construction
- while loops
- pointers to variables
